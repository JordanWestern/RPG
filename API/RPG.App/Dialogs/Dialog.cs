       "Darkness looms. A desolate wasteland stretches out before you. the remnants of a world that once thrived. Jagged rocks pierce the barren earth, and the wind carries whispers of a forgotten age. In the time before, this land was rich with life, magic, and steel. Kingdoms rose and fell under the watchful eyes of gods and mortals alike. But now... now, only shadows remain. \r\n\r\nA haunting silence settles, broken only by the distant cry of an unknown creature. The great cities lie in ruin, their secrets buried beneath the sands. Once-powerful warriors and mages, now legends, their names all but forgotten. But you... you are not of the past; You are the future. In this cursed land, where the sun barely rises and the night never truly ends, your path begins. You feel a strange energy in the air, a tension that hints at danger and discovery alike. The road ahead is treacherous, but within you lies the spark of hope – a spark that might just ignite the flames of a new dawn.";
